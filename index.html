                    <div>
                        <p>I am currently in my fourth-year of the Honours Bachelor of Software Engineering and Co-op (B.Eng) program at Ontario Tech University. </p>

                        <p>I am interested in all aspects of project and software development, and I am working towards a P.Eng designation.</p>

                        <p>For the first three years of my degree I was a member of the varsity rowing team, but have taken a step back to focus on my professional development this year. I am a member of several other clubs/societies and academic groups.
                            I was the undergraduate representative for the Ontario Tech Academic Council for the 2021-2022 year, a Senior Peer Leader for the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, an ambassador for the Engineering Society at the University,
                            and I am a founding member and current executive of OTeaU (tea club).</p>

                            <p>During my time at Ontario Tech, I have had an opportunity to develop my skills in a variety of programming languages. I was also an intern at Veoneer Canada for 16 months in which I was the lead developer in the IT department.</p>
